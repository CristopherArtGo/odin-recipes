    <h1 id="header">Cheeseburger</h1>
    <img src="../images/cheeseburger.jpg" alt="Picture of Buttermilk Pancakes" height="300"/>
    <p>American culture has widely influenced my country, the Philippines, and lo and behold one of the most important inventions (more like alterations) of the americans is the cheeseburger. I have been a fan of cheeseburgers when one of the foreigners here in my local city opened up a burger restaurant and this was in 2019.</p>
    <h3>Places where I get my cheeseburgers:</h3>

            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>

        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare burger bun by laying toppings on bottom half of bun. Have it nearby and ready for when your burger is cooked.</li>
            <li>Preheat a large stainless steel saut√© pan or skillet over high heat for 2 minutes. Place balls of beef in pan and smash down with a stiff metal spatula, using a second spatula to add pressure. Smashed patties should be slightly wider than burger bun.</li>
            <li>Season generously with salt and pepper and allow to cook until patties are well browned and tops are beginning to turn pale pink/gray in spots, about 45 seconds. Using a bench scraper or the back side of a stiff metal spatula, carefully scrape patties from pan, making sure to get all of the browned bits.</li>
            <li>Flip patties and immediately place a slice of cheese over 1 patty, then stack the second directly on top. Immediately remove from pan and transfer to waiting burger bun. Serve.</li>
        </ol>
