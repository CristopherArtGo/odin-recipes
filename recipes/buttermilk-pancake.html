    <p>Pancakes have been one of my favorite foods since I was a kid. The fluffy texture and buttery taste accompanied by the sweetness of the maple or corn syrup simply makes these a staple in my list of cheat meals.</p>
    <h3>Places where I get my pancakes:</h3>

        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, add the flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, and baking soda, and whisk to combine.</li>
            <li>In a bowl or measuring cup, whisk the buttermilk, eggs, and melted butter until smooth.</li>
            <li>Add the buttermilk mixture to the dry ingredients, gently incorporating with a spatula. Make sure not to overmix, as that will result in dense pancakes.</li>
            <li>Add the butter to a pan over medium low heat. Once the butter begins to bubble, add â…“ cup (80 ml) of batter to the pan.</li>
            <li>Cook until the top side begins to bubble and the bottom is golden brown. Flip the pancake and cook until the underside is golden brown. Repeat with the remaining batter.</li>
        </ol>
